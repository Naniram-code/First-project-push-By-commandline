Git = Code Version Control System => Git commands | like Git -> SVN
GitHub = Central Repository | like GitHub -> Bitbucket

1. open source
2. to maintain project being performed parallely within the team and achieve continious updates in project without issue.

3. Download Git & install
4. Create account in GitHub (common central repository)
5. Git command communicates with GitHub repository to push/pull codes
6. GitHub will smartly merge new codes with the old codes already present in the respository
7. sometime might show merge conflict - if 2 or more people writes same code - where merging can only be done after conflict resolution manually

8. instead of Git command = tools to communicate with GitHub respository - Tortoise Git/Eclipse/Intellij

9. Git command - https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/basic-git-commands-776639767.html

######Steps in command prompt to push code#########

10. Tell git who you are -
	git config --global user.name "name"
	git config --global user.email "email address"

11. Create folder and put files to be pushed in GitHub - also create respository in GitHub where code is going to be pushed 
	- then go to folder va command prompt
	cd folder path

12. Initialize as Git repository -
	git init

13. Add Git code to stagging -
	git add *
	git add <file name> (if you are going to add specific file)

14. To check the status of stagged code -
	git status

15. To commit the code that is in stagging -
	git commit -m "message to commit"

16. Defining which branch are you pushing
	git branch -M main

17. Provide location of respository where code needs to be pushed to establish connection between location folder and remote folder -
  	git remote add origin repository path

18. Then push to master branch -
	git push -u origin main

19. Then provide credentials for GitHub account -
	username - 
	password - access token

20. Code will get pushed into the GitHub repository - refresh the GitHub page - you will be able to see fresh code with the message provided will commiting


########Steps to extract code from repository#####

20. To extract the code for the first time from the GitHub -
	- within the folder do
	git clone link of the repository

21. For update later no need clone -
	git pull link of the repository

22. to create new branch
	git branch branchName
23. to switch to new branch
	git checkout branchName
24. to merge new branch to master
	first - git checkout master
	then - git merge branchName
25. to create new branch content in new branch in gitHub
	git push origin branchName
26. to merge into master branch from new branch in gitHub
	raise pull request, then accept it and merge
	or, push master that is merged in local repo to master in GitHub


27. to pull specific files from repo
	git checkout master -- index.php
	


Sequence:
1. Pushing project/file for the first time:
	Initialize the folder(adding .git) -> stagging -> commit ->push
2. Pushing changes afterwards:
	stagging -> commit ->push
3. First time pulling project into the device:
	Initialize the folder(adding .git)->clone from remote repository (GitHub) into the folder
4. Pulling changes afterwards:
	Pull command
